# Falling-2D-boxes

A base project that integrates Bullet Physics with FreeGlut. Click on the screen and a randomly colored box will fall from that position.
Good for using as a base project for more complicated simulations.
May need to build and link your own bullet physics projects such as bullet dynamics, bullet collision, and linearmath.
